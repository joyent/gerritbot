## Configuration

The configuration file contains the following values:

- `"my_name"`, the host name workers should use to connect back to the
  supervisor server
- `"port"`, the port that the supervisor server should listen on
- `"spares"`, the number of spare worker zones to maintain
- `"max"`, the maximum number of worker zones that should be allowed to run
- `"dryrun"`, a boolean indicating whether the `"make check"` results should be
  posted to Gerrit
- `"gerrit"`, an object describing how to connect to Gerrit:
    -- `"host"`, the Gerrit instance's hostname
    -- `"port"`, the SSH port that Gerrit is listening on
    -- `"user"`, the user to listen and post as to Gerrit
